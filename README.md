# Distributed-Database-with-Raft-Consensus-Algorithm

Implemented a database storing string key-value pairs using Raft Consensus Algorithm, ensuring consistent data replication and fault recovery across the distributed network of nodes.
Obtained Linearizable Reads without paying high latency penalties for each request by utilizing the leader lease mechanism, similar to those used by geo distributed databases such as Cockroach DB and YugaByte DB.
